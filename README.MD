#Prototype Engine
It is a complete python based 2D game engine with its own ecs. It makes use of pygame library for 2D rendering and pyimgui for editor interface.

I never intended to develop an engine. I started making a tic tac toe game with AI mode using minimax algorithm to learn python. Then after completion of the game it seemed incomplete and I wanted to enhance it. 

Then I decided to write a game engine to make simple board games like tic tac toe, dots, hangman, chess, checkers, etc. I wanted to make a full tic tac toe game with a decent interface with the my game engine.
